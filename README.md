plugins that makes it easy to develop web application with CRM functionality.

## Campaign Management Plugin

This plugin provide storage and services for managing many types of campaigns in GR8 CRM applications.

Note that this plugin does not contain any user interface components. This plugin contains domain classes and services only.
The plugin [crm-campaign-ui](http://gr8crm.github.io/plugins/crm-campaign-ui/) provides a Twitter Bootstrap based user interface for managing campaigns.
**crm-campaign-ui** depends on **crm-campaign** so you only need to include **crm-campaign-ui**
in your BuildConfig.groovy if you want end-user campaign management features.

The plugin supports the following types of campaigns:

- Banners campaigns. Render ads/banners on a web page and control what should be displayed and when from the campaign
- Information campaigns. Render different content depending on the visitors origin (utm_source, campaign query parameter, etc)
- Product discount. If you use the **crm-product** plugin you can apply different discounts depending on campaign setup
- Email marketing. Compose HTML emails and send to target groups. With support for open/click statistics.
