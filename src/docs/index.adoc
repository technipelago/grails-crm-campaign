== Introduction

{gr8crm} is a set of http://www.grails.org/[Grails Web Application Framework]
plugins that makes it easy to develop web applications with CRM functionality.

You can find more information about {gr8crm} on the main documentation site {homepage}.

=== Customer Relationship Management

Customer relationship management (CRM) is a system for managing a company’s interactions with current and future customers.
It involves using technology to organize, automate and synchronize sales, marketing, customer service, and technical support.
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Customer_relationship_management[Wikipedia]

The {gr8crm} "Ecosystem" currently contains over 40 Grails plugins. For a complete list of plugins see {homepage}.

Each {gr8crm} plugin defines a http://martinfowler.com/bliki/BoundedContext.html[Bounded Context]
that focus on one specific domain, for example *contact*, *project* or *document*.

== Campaign Management Plugin

This plugin provide storage and services for managing many types of campaigns  in {gr8crm} applications.

Note that this plugin does not contain any user interface components. This plugin contains domain classes and services only.
The plugin http://gr8crm.github.io/plugins/crm-campaign-ui/[crm-campaign-ui] provides a Twitter Bootstrap based user interface for managing campaigns.
`crm-campaign-ui` depends on `crm-campaign` so you only need to include `crm-campaign-ui`
in your BuildConfig.groovy if you want end-user campaign management features.

== Domain Model

=== CrmCampaign


== CrmCampaignService

Like most other {gr8crm} plugins this plugin have a main service with methods for creating, searching and updating campaigns.

=== Create campaign status

`CrmCampaignStatus createCampaignStatus(Map params, boolean save = false)`

Campaign status is mandatory on a campaign and different campaign statuses can be created with `createCampaignStatus()`.

=== Create a new campaign

`CrmCampaign createCampaign(Map params, boolean save = false)`

To create a new campaign you call the `createCampaign(Map, boolean)` method with a map of property values and a boolean
to indicate if the campaign should be persisted inside the method or if you want to persist it later yourself.

[source,groovy]
.CreateCampaign.groovy
----
def c = crmCampaignService.createCampaign(...);

println "Campaign $c created with status ${c.status}"
----

=== Banner Campaign

A banner campaign is used when you want to display a banner image on your web page with a link that leads to
a page with more information. A banner campaign uses {homepage}/plugins/crm-content[crm-content] plugin to store banner images.

[source,groovy]
.CreateBannerCampaigns.groovy
----
def grailsApplication
def bannerCampaign <1>

final ApplicationContext ctx = grailsApplication.mainContext
final CrmCampaignStatus status = crmCampaignService.createCampaignStatus(orderIndex: 2,
        name: "Active campaign", param: "active", true)

final CrmCampaign parentCampaign = crmCampaignService.createCampaign(number: "banner",
        name: "Banners on home page", description: "Parent campaign for all banners on home page",
        status: status, true) <2>

def createCampaign = { name, desc, img, link -> <3>
    def c = crmCampaignService.createCampaign(parent: parentCampaign, status: status,
            name: name, description: desc, code: "ads", true)
    if(c.hasErrors()) {
        throw new RuntimeException("Cannot create campaign")
    } else {
        def image = ctx.getResource(img).file <4>
        image.withInputStream { is ->
            crmCampaignService.addCampaignResource(c, is, "banner.jpg", image.length(), "image/jpeg")
        }
        bannerCampaign.configure(c) {
          url link <5>
        }
    }
}
// Create three campaigns, one for each of our new amazing products.
createCampaign "Product X", "Our amazing new Product X...",
        "images/banners/product-x.jpg", "http://mywebshop.com/view/product-x"
createCampaign "Product Y", "Our amazing new Product Y...",
        "images/banners/product-y.jpg", "http://mywebshop.com/view/product-y"
createCampaign "Product Z", "Our amazing new Product Z...",
        "images/banners/product-z.jpg", "http://mywebshop.com/view/product-z"
----
<1> Inject the BannerCampaign bean so we can use it to configure our campaigns.
<2> Create a parent campaign that group all banner campaigns.
<3> Create a closure to make it easy to create sub-campaigns.
<4> Banner images are located in web-app/images/banners so we can get them via ApplicationContext.
<5> Each sub-campaign is configured with the link to more information.

.Rendering banners

To display the three banners we created above we can call the `images` action in `CrmCampaignResourceController`
to get a list of images. In the following example we use Javascript and jQuery to add all images to a banner area
on our web page. When the visitor clicks on an image it will redirect the browser to the configured link.

[source,javascript]
----
$.getJSON("/crmCampaignResource/images?t=1&code=ads", function(data) { <1>
    var container = $("#banners");
    for(var i = 0; i < data.length; i++) {
        var banner = data[i];
        var $img = $("<img/>").attr("src", banner.uri).attr("alt", banner.title);
        var $link = $("<a/>").attr("href", banner.url).attr("target", '_blank')
                .attr("title", banner.title);
        $link.append($img);
        $container.append($link);
    }
});
----
<1> Because GR8 CRM is always multi-tenant we must specify in which tenant our campaigns are stored (t=1).

=== Information Campaign

If you develop a public facing site with GR8 CRM you can display different content depending on where your visitors
come from. For example if they come via a link on Twitter you can display one type of content, if they come via
Facebook you can display another type of content.

[source,groovy]
.CreateInformationCampaign
----
def status = crmCampaignService.createCampaignStatus(name: 'Active campaign', param: 'active', true)
def twitter = crmCampaignService.createCampaign(number: "twitter-app-2016", code: "twitter", status: status,
    name: "Tweets", description: "Visitors that came to us via a tweet", true)
def text = """
<h3>Download our Twitter App</h3>
<div class="pull-right">
   <@link controller="download" action="index" query="id=twitter-app" class="btn btn-success">Download</@link>
</div>
<p>With our new Twitter app you can do amazing things...</p>
"""
crmCampaignService.addCampaignResource(twitter, text, "twitter-app.ftl", [contentType: "text/html")
----

With one or more campaigns (created above) we can use the `<crm:campaign>` GSP tag to render the text.

[source,groovy]
.Config.groovy
----
crm {
    campaign {
        landingParam = ['utm_source', 'campaign', '_c] <1>
        landingPages = [home: 'index'] <2>
        sessionParam = 'campaign' <3>
    }
}
----
<1> A list of known campaign source query parameters. This list is used to lookup the right campaign.
<2> The landing pages that will trigger campaign lookup, in this example it's HomeController.index.
<3> If a campaign is found a reference to it is stored in a HTTP session attribute called 'campaign'.

[source,html]
.home/index.gsp
----
<div class="well">
    <crm:campaign campaign="${request.session.campaign}" template="default-campaign.ftl"/> <1>
</div>
----
<1> If the session attribute 'campaign' is non-null the text for that campaign is rendered.
Otherwise a default text template is rendered using the 'crm-content' plugin.

=== Product Discount Campaign

If you develop a web shop with the `crm-product` plugin you can configure product campaigns to offer discounts or
value-add products for your customers. The `ProductDiscountCampaign` handler is very flexible with lots of
configuration options.

The following example applies 10 % discount on "Product X" products if the customer lands on our home page or web shop
and a campaign source query parameter has the value "twitter".

[source,groovy]
.Config.groovy
----
crm {
    campaign {
        landingParam = ['utm_source', 'campaign', '_c]
        landingPages = ['home|blog|webshop': 'index']
        sessionParam = 'campaign'
        productDiscountCampaign.round = true
    }
}
----

[source,groovy]
.CreateProductDiscountCampaign
----
def status = crmCampaignService.createCampaignStatus(name: 'Active campaign', param: 'active', true)
def twitter = crmCampaignService.createCampaign(number: "twitter2016", code: "twitter", status: status,
    name: "Promotion for twitter users", description: "Follow us on Twitter to receive a 10 % discount on Product X.")
productDiscountCampaign.configure(twitter) {
    products = ['productXbasic', 'productXpro', 'productXultimate'] <1>
    discount = 0.10 <2>
    condition = 'any' <3>
}
campaign.save(failOnError: true)
----
<1> Only apply discount on a limited list of products.
<2> 10 % discount
<3> The discount is applied without any amount threshold.
If condition is a number the discount will only be applied if the total shopping cart value is higher than 'condition'.

See https://github.com/technipelago/grails-crm-campaign/blob/master/test/integration/grails/plugins/crm/campaign/ProductDiscountCampaignSpec.groovy[ProductDiscountCampaignSpec.groovy] for more examples.

=== Email Campaign

[source,groovy]
.CreateEmailCampaign.groovy
----
def emailCampaign <1>

def active = crmCampaignService.createCampaignStatus(name: "Active", true)
def campaign = crmCampaignService.createCampaign(name: "Test campaign", status: active, true)
emailCampaign.configure(campaign) {
    subject = "Test"
    sender = "info@mycompany.com"
    parts = ['html', 'text']
    html = """<h1>Hello World!</h1>"""
    text = """Hello World!"""
} <2>
crmEmailCampaignService.createRecipients(campaign, ['me@mycompany.com', 'joe.average@customer.com']) <3>
crmEmailCampaignService.send() <4>
----
<1> Inject the EmailCampaign bean so we can use it to configure our campaign.
<2> Configure the email layout and other email parameters.
<3> Add two recipients.
<4> Start the campaign. This will send the email to the recipients.
